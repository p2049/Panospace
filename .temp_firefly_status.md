✅ **Firefly Overlay System Complete!**

## Summary

### 🎯 What I Did:

1. **Simplified to 2 Firefly Options:**
   - **Fireflies** (Normal density - medium, slow speed)
   - **Firefly Swarm** (High density - more fireflies, medium speed)

2. **Added Color Variants:**
   - 6 color options: **Golden** (default), Mint, Blue, Pink, Green, Purple
   - Each overlay stores its colorVariants in `bannerOverlays.js`

3. **Made Fireflies Compatible with Everything:**
   - Set `compatibleWith: '*'` for both overlays
   - Updated `areOverlaysCompatible()` to handle wildcard compatibility
   - Fireflies can now combo with **any other visual overlay!**

4. **Updated Renderer:**
   - Modified `BannerOverlayRenderer.jsx` to accept `selectedColor` property
   - Firefly color now dynamically changes based on selected variant

### 🎨 Color Picker UI (In Progress):

I've added the state management for color selection in `BannerOverlaySelector.jsx`:
- `overlayColors` state tracks selected color for each overlay
- `cycleColor()` function to switch between color variants
- Need to finalize the UI with left/right arrows and color label

### ✨ Next Steps:

The color picker UI needs to be integrated into the overlay cards. Once complete
