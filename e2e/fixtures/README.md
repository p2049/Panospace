# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test images for E2E testing:

- `test-image-normal.jpg`: A normal landscape photograph for testing standard upload flow
- `test-image-ai.jpg`: A synthetic/AI-generated image for testing AI detection rejection
- `test-image-nudity.jpg`: A placeholder image representing inappropriate content for testing content moderation

Note: The nudity test image is a placeholder and does not contain actual inappropriate content. It's used to test the content moderation flow with mocked detection responses.
